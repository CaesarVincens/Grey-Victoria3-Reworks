### Originally just the Defaults - With state tax capacity changes to rebalance for urban changes.
### But actually, ownership buildings employ vastly too many people late-game.

## If you have a pm with building_company_worker_dividends_add and you want one of the owner building shareholders to receive the same dividends as the workforce...
## E.g. it looks something like this:
##			building_capitalists_shares_add = 7.5
##			building_academics_shares_add   = 5
##			building_clergymen_shares_add   = 3
##			building_company_worker_dividends_add = 0.25
## Then you start with the ratio of:
##		num_of_workers/building_company_worker_dividends_add = 
##			PopNumA/(((PNA*ShareValA)/(PNA*SVA+PNB*SVB))*(1-building_company_worker_dividends_add))
##		i.e.: F/C = A/(((A*x)/(A*x+H*y))*(1-C))
##	And the general equations are: 
##		ShareValA = -(building_company_worker_dividends_add*PopNumB*ShareValB)/
##					(PopNumA*building_company_worker_dividends_add + (-1 + building_company_worker_dividends_add)*num_of_workers)
##	Or:
##		ShareValB = ((-PopNumA*building_company_worker_dividends_add + num_of_workers - building_company_worker_dividends_add*num_of_workers)*ShareValA)/
##					(building_company_worker_dividends_add*PopNumB)
##					
##	Where:
##		A = PopNumA = sum of all pops you want parity for
##		x = ShareValA = numerical value of the shares for PopTypeA (typically 1)
##		H = PopNumB = sum of all pops receiving higher shares
##		y = ShareValB = the higher value of the shares for PopTypeB (which you are trying to calculate)
##		C = building_company_worker_dividends_add = per the applicable modifier from either a Law or the PM
##		F = num_of_workers = the number of workers employed in the normal building
##
##	You can wolfram this formula like: solve x = -(C H y)/(A C + (-1 + C) F), A = 30, H = 20, C = 0.75, F = 1000		<-- x = ShareValA
##								or: solve y = ((-A C + F - C F) x)/(C H), A = 30, H = 20, C = 0.75, F = 1000			<-- y = ShareValB
##		This will give you a result like: y = (91/6)x
##		Which you can either resolve to: ShareValA = 1, ShareValB = 15.166
##									or: ShareValA = 6, ShareValB = 91
## E.g. it looks something like this:
##			building_capitalists_shares_add = 91
##			building_academics_shares_add   = 6
##			building_clergymen_shares_add   = 6
##			building_company_worker_dividends_add = 0.75
##
##	If the building workforce varies, use the minimum workforce number, and this will mean that the dividends the workers receive has a ceiling equivalent to PopTypeA.
